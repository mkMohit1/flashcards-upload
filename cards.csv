"What is React?","React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update them in response to data changes."
"What is JSX?","JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. It makes React code more readable and easier to maintain.  It gets transformed into regular JavaScript function calls."
"What are React components?","React components are independent, reusable pieces of code that define a part of the user interface. They can be functional components (using functions) or class components (using ES6 classes)."
"What is the purpose of the `useState` hook?","The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components. It allows you to declare a state variable and a function to update that variable, triggering a re-render of the component when the state changes."
"What is the Virtual DOM in React and why is it important?","The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to efficiently update the real DOM by comparing the changes between the Virtual DOM and the real DOM, only updating the necessary parts. This improves performance."
