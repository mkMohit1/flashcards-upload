"What is React?","React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or UI components. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update them in response to data changes."
"What is JSX?","JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. It's not HTML itself, but it gets transformed into regular JavaScript function calls to create React elements."
"What are React components?","React components are independent and reusable pieces of code. They accept inputs called ""props"" and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. Components can be either functional components (using functions) or class components (using classes)."
"What are ""props"" in React?","""Props"" (short for properties) are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component. They are a way to customize and configure child components."
"What is ""state"" in React?","""State"" is data that is managed *within* a React component. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be changed by the component itself, triggering a re-render of the component and its children. State is what allows components to be dynamic and interactive."
