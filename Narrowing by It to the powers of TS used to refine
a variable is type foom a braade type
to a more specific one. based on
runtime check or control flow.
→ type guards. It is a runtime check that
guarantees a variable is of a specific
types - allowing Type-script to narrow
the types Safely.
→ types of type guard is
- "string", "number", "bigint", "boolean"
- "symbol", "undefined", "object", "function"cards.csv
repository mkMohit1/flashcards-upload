### Topic: Type Guards"

"How do type guards help TypeScript?","Type guards allow TypeScript to safely narrow the types of variables based on runtime information."

### Topic: `typeof` Type Guards"
"What are the valid string results of the `typeof` operator in TypeScript?","The valid string results of the `typeof` operator are ""string"", ""number"", ""bigint"", ""boolean"", ""symbol"", ""undefined"", ""object"", and ""function""."
"How can the `typeof` operator be used as a type guard?","By checking the `typeof` a variable against one of the valid string results, you can create a type guard that narrows the variable's type within a conditional block."
"Give an example of using `typeof` as a type guard.","The code uses `typeof value === ""string""` as a type guard. Inside the `if` block, TypeScript knows `value` is a string, and in the `else` block, it knows `value` is a number."
